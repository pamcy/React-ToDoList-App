Recently I started learning React and develope this sample To-Do List App fully in React. This application is with three types, all todos, in progress and completed.

## Demo

**Live URL:** []()

## What I learned from this project

- [x] Handle form in React with uncontrolled & controlled components
- [x] Multiple checkbox / toggle state
- [x] Render along with multiple <Route>s that match the URL
- [x] Render each list according to their task status
- [x] Most important task is at the top of the page
- [x] Store todo items in localStorage

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`

## Development

1. `npm start`: Run the app in development mode.
2. `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder.
