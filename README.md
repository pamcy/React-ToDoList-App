Recently I started learning React and develope this sample To-Do List App fully in React.<br>
This application is with three task types and routes, all todos, in progress and completed.

_The To-Do list template designed and shared by [Hexschool(六角學院)](https://hexschool.github.io/THE_F2E_Design/todolist/)_

## What I learned from this project

- [x] Handle form in React with uncontrolled & controlled components
- [x] Multiple checkbox / toggle state
- [x] Render along with multiple Routes that match the URL
- [x] Render each list based on their task status
- [x] Most important task is at the top of the page
- [x] Store todo items in localStorage

## Installation

2. Run `npm install`
